        <h2>BIO:</h2>
         <p>I was born in a little logging town called Sedro-Woolley, Washington state in the Skagit Valley County area. My born town is 
           very unique and a very beautiful place but also ugly at the same time, because the town is very historic and has a lot of history. Most of the 
           building has murals on the side of them. The of the mural painting are of the old logging days in sedro-woolley, the loggers who worked hard to 
           suport their families. Which during those times was the top best paying job in the area. A lot of the old small towns that are in rural areas in my 
           home state of Washington are old, unique, historic and that makes it much more special to me. Plus all of the beauiful natural forests, woods and mountains.
           Sedro-Woolley, my home town sets at the base of the cascade mountains range, Starting with Mt. Baker that overlooks the whole town. Its so beautiful and Its 
           also a volcano. I grew up in a surrounging town/city that is called Mt. Vernon, Washington, This is my home town. Which is also old and historic. In my home 
           town we have this old theater called the lincoln theater. When I was little for some silly reason or other I thought thats where the president lincoln got 
           shot and killed at. I was wrong, but its funny that I would even think like that. Probably because lincoln was shot and killed at a theater and this threater 
           happens to be called the lincoln theater. As a kid growing up in the 80's and 90's I was totally into video games and computers. I was always intrigued by 
           computer. I remember the first time I ever saw a computer, when my grandpa came home with one, one day. I think it was a IBM PC, or a old apple mac computer.
           I remember saying to my grandpa, "What is that?" and then "that's a weird TV". I was fascinated by it. Actually, I do think it was a IBM PC, because I can't 
           stand a apple mac computer. I despites apple computers, even tho I like Steve Jobs. I respect Steve Jobs as a servant and innovator of he's time's. I respect 
           people like that, because I've been told by my teacher throughout my childhood that I was very smart, intellagent, one even went as far as to say that I was 
           on a genius level. I've always hated hearing this and I was very quick and fast to saying "No, I'm not quit saying I'm a genius" I would get mad because I didn't 
           feel like one, I didn't even think I was smart at all. I had a learning disability and I didn't have dyslexia, I don't Know what kind of learning disability 
           I had, but the my teacher's reinsured my mom that I was very smart and intellagent. In high school I use to do the whole basketball team homework because I was 
           bored a lot and my homework would always be completed before school would end for the day. Then I smarted up and let everyone on the basketball team take my 
           homework so they could copy it on there homework. Then one day I had to search for my homework, which was normal, but usually it would just be a few people,
           This time I had to go to 25 to 30 different people before I could find my homework. So I started charging people once I realize how many people were coping 
           my homework. I realize that I could make some money off of this. I learned a lot about computers in high school vo-tech classes that would last for the 
           first 4 hour's of my school day. I learned how to build computers, which I built my own for class and same with my peers in class with me. I learned a little 
           bit of everything about computers, I also learned how to code for the first time in this class. I first learned html that was called Xhtml, which was xml and 
           html combined together. I didn't learned css or javascript, because our teacher didn't want to teach to much about it. I lost interest in computers for a 
           while. I tryed to join the Navy in 2002 after I graduated from high school. I was denied because I had a bad knee and it would get worse over time. In 2004, 
           I got my CNA certification and did that for a while until I got a job at amazon fulfillment center at STL3. Which lead me to amazon career choice and fullstack
           academy for web development. My first year at amazon was rough, because me and my wife van broke down and I had to ride a bicycle to work and home. Don't sound so bad 
           other then the fact that here in missouri is rough to ride a bicycle like that. Missouri has hills that feel like mountains, blind curve and corners and 
           you can't see on the other side of it and it's very easy to get hit by a car. Now me and my wife just got a 2017 buick encore which is the newest car I ever owned.
           As of right now I work for Amazon, Lyft as a driver, and Uber. I'm also a Dasher, but I don't like Doordash that much.

        <div><p>Spotify is my favorite music app/website. They have a lot music and I like the 
          layout of it all. I tried other music apps and sites, but I keep on coming back to Spotify.
          I know that Spotify is a little expensive, but with their high quality music files you really can't 
          beat their quality of sound. Plus if your a premium membership, You can do a lot more with Spotify.
          Like spotify has a extension on VS Code to play music in your terminal. I can't get mine to work at the 
          moment. You can also use their embedded code off of your music playlist, like I did above this paragraph.
          Spotify just has a lot of potential and can really one day turn into something far greater then it is now.
          I hope, one day I will get the privilege to work for Spotify as a Web Developer</p>

            <p>Lyft is my second job, On my day's off from Amazon, I go out and 
              drive with lyft. Before I started driving with Lyft, I was a Lyft rider for about 
              6 to 7 months before I got my New Encore, Now I am the Lyft. I enjoy driving for Lyft
              it's pretty relaxing for me and plus I make money at the same time. I make my own schedule 
              and I can drive when and where ever I want, Its pretty cool, and perfect for a second job.
